# Vehicle Door Safety Monitoring System

This project uses a Raspberry Pi and YOLOv3-Tiny to detect nearby objects when a vehicle door is opened, triggering a buzzer for safety. It uses computer vision and real-time object detection to prevent accidents caused by opening the door into oncoming traffic.

## Requirements

- Python 3.12+
- Libraries:opencv-python, numpy, gpiozero (for simulation on non-Raspberry Pi systems)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd VEHICLE_DOOR_SAFETY
